# Readable

Readable is a content and comment web app that was developed by using React and [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com). Users will be able to post content to 3 predefined categories (redux, react or udacity), comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This project was developed as a part of the [Udacity's React course](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## How to start the app
This project provides a client and an api-server. The api-server was provided by udacity at a [github starter project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). More information about the provided endpoints, you can see in its [README file](api-server/README.md).

Install and run the API server:
```
cd api-server
npm install
node server
```

After running the API server, install and run the client web app:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
